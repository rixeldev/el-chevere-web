  "FAQ_Q_1": "What differences exist between the \"digital\" process and the \"time\" process?",
  "FAQ_QA_1": "The main difference lies in the date on which the photos are delivered to the client.",
  "FAQ_QA_2": "Digital photos taken before 5:00 PM will be delivered to the client during the same day, during business hours: 8:00 AM - 7:00 PM. High-resolution, high-quality photos.",
  "FAQ_QA_3": "Timelapse photos, taken during business hours: 8:00 AM - 7:00 PM, will be delivered to the client physically, with the studio's watermark, within 2 to 3 days, depending on the quality of the selected photos, and will then be sent digitally, but not with the same quality as the digital version. Each photo will have the company's watermark.",
  "FAQ_Q_2": "I have an old photo and I need to update it. Can you help me?",
  "FAQ_QA_4": "Yes, at El Foto Estudio El Chévere we work with the type of photo that the client desires. The final quality of the old photos will depend on how damaged the original photo is. We call this process \"reproduction\".",
  "FAQ_Q_3": "Do you also work with framing?",
  "FAQ_QA_5": "Yes. We have a wide variety of pictures for shelves and walls. The final picture and design is shown to the client in person, once the photo is printed, so that they can choose the one they like best based on the style of the photo.",
  "FAQ_Q_4": "Amateur photos",
  "FAQ_QA_6": "These are external photos, not taken in the studio. That is, photos sent by WhatsApp, by email, extracted from a USB memory stick, extracted from a CD and other external means. The price and size will depend on the user, with each size having a different price.",
  "FAQ_Q_5": "What sizes are handled?",
  "FAQ_QA_7": "We currently carry a wide variety of sizes for printed photos for shelves, walls, formal documents, etc. Sizes from 2x2 inches to 20x24 inches and other variants.",
  "FAQ_Q_6": "What if I want to have a photo shoot in a park far from the studio?",
  "FAQ_QA_8": "We also specialize in outdoor photos (outside the studio) such as weddings, baptisms, 15 years old birthdays, outdoor portraits and other styles.",
  "FAQ_Q_7": "Can you send me all the unedited shots?",
  "FAQ_QA_9": "No, we don't send unedited shots. We only send photos edited and selected by the client. Unedited shots are discarded after a certain time, or, if the client wishes, the photos can be saved for future selection."
